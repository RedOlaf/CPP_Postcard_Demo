Photograph of Ryuzan (Yongsan) railway station building completed between 1900 and 1915. Ryuzan (Yongsan) was a riverside district of Keijo (Kyung Sung), convenient to the rail bridges crossing the Han river and serving rail traffic from multiple lines. Developing Korea's railway infrastructure was a major focus of Japanese authorities. Japanese firms had been instrumental in laying the first rail lines even before Japanese colonial rule was formalized in 1910, and the Director General of Railway Bureau of the Government General of Chosen was one of the most powerful colonial officials. Postcards were issued by the Railway Bureau celebrating the wonders modern engineering (bridges, tunnels, rail lines), the beauty spots of the Korean peninsula (with first-class hotels for rail travellers), and the fact that rail networks connected the peninsula to the exterior. Amid this headlong rush to modernize through heavy industry and transport, the european-influenced design of the Ryuzan station building (with elements reminiscent of Swiss challets and the English half-timbered houses) was designed to convince the world of Korea's modernity and cosmopolitinism under Japanese rule.",railroad station;city;Keijo,"Yongsan Station, Seoul, Korea",37.5287,126.9652,Cal Poly Pomona Global South Postcard Collection,KPr000_2.jpg,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,jap;eng,Public Domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/

Colorized photograph of a gisaeng in traditional Korean Hanbok in the kitchen. Gisaeng (Kisaeng, 기생) were professional government entertainers who played an important part in the traditional culture of Korea. First appearing in the Goreyo Dynasty (918-1932), they were spread throughout the country as a distinct social group in the Joseon Dyansty (1392-1897). Gisaeng were rigorously trained in the fine arts, poetry, prose, music, and dance, and were respected for their performance as educated artists despite their low social rank. Under the Japanese rule, the official training system for gisaeng was abolished and the image of gisaeng was recreated as the object of the tourist gaze by the colonial power. The postcards of gisaeng, made and sold in sets under the name of “Chosŏn Customs,” reproduced the image of gisaeng as an exotic beauty, overemphasizing gisaeng’s sexual image and reducing the culturally significant female artists to a tourist spectacle. The postcards were mainly purchased by Japanese males who visited Korea in the 1920s but were  exported to China and other countries in Europe, too.

The weak and effeminate image of Korea disseminated by the postcards was often used to justify the Japanese colonial rule.

Naming the district honmachi (the center of the town; (本) (hon) means ""base, root, origin"" and (町) (machi) means “street” or “town”), Japanese merchants started occupying the district since the end of the Joseon dynasty. Lined with luxurious shops for jewelry, cosmetics, books, foods, stationery, and other merchandise, the avenue became the center of commerce for Japanese merchants during the Japanese colonial period. After liberation, it was named Chungmu-ro after Admiral Yi Sun-shin, a Korean national hero famous for his victories against the Japanese navy that tried to invade the country in the 1590s. It was one of Korea's symbolic attempts to clear away the remnants of Japanese colonialism.
